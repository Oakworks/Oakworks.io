        <h1 id="automatically-collected-information">Automatically Collected Information</h1>
        <p>The Company may automatically collect information about your computer hardware and software. This information
            can
            include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website addresses. This
            information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide
            general
            statistics regarding the use of the Company&#39;s website.</p>
        <h1 id="use-of-cookies">Use of Cookies</h1>
        <p>The Company&#39;s website may use &quot;cookies&quot; to help you personalize your online experience. A
            cookie is
            a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
            deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server
            in
            the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
        <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a
            cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize
            the
            Company&#39;s pages, or register with Company&#39;s site or services, a cookie helps the Company to recall
            your
            specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
            information,
            such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same website, the
            information
            you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Company&#39;s features that you
            customized.
        </p>
        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you
            can
            usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you
            may
            not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Company&#39;s services or websites you
            visit.

        <h1 id="security-of-your-personal-information">Security of your Personal Information</h1>
        <p>The Company secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The Company uses
            the
            following methods for this purpose:</p>

            <li>SSL Protocol</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected

                likely
                to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, provided we have obtained
                your
                informed consent;</li>
